            <p> Hello, my name is Ella Raputri, a freshman at Binus International, majoring in 
                Computer Science. I like Math and Science since I was in elementary school. I have also participated
                in many Math competitions and a few olympiad-related organizations since I was in 
                high school, so I decided to continue my higher education and career path in Engineering, 
                specifically in software engineering. Those experiences also helped to shape the current me that 
                have a passion for learning Math, and programming, while also teaching others at the same time. <br/> <br/>
            </p>

            <p>These are some of my high school's picture. I'm in the centre :D</p>

            <p>
                As for my personality, many people said that I am a responsible and hard-working
                person, but a little too introverted sometimes, so my friend's first impression for me is mostly a quiet and mysterious person. 
                I have a habit of organizing my schedule throughout the day and I enjoy having that satisfying
                feeling when I have achieved my target for the day. My target for my future now is to become a successful
                person to repay my parents' kindness and to contribute to society.
